If a request timed out, you usually have to call that request again by yourself. **AFNetworking+RetryPolicy** is an **objective-c** category that adds the ability to set the retry logic for requests made with [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking).

## Features
- [x] **retryCount** - How many times to try.
- [x] **retryInterval** - Time interval between attempts in seconds.
- [x] **progressive** - Next attempt will always take more time than the previous one. *(Uses Exponentiation)*
- [x] **fatalStatusCodes** - These will trigger failure block immediately when received and ends current retry.

## Getting started
- Installing through **[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)** with `pod 'AFNetworking+RetryPolicy'`
- Use `#import "AFHTTPSessionManager+RetryPolicy.h"` directive.

> Want to try it first? Use `pod try AFNetworking+RetryPolicy` command.

## Usage
### Example
- Simple `GET` request with **AFNetworking+RetryPolicy** could look like this:

```objective-c
    AFHTTPSessionManager *manager = [AFHTTPSessionManager new];
    [manager GET:@"foo" parameters:nil headers:nil progress:nil success:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, id responseObject) {
        NSLog(@"%@", responseObject);
        
    } failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, NSError *error) {
        NSLog(@"%@", error.localizedDescription);
        
    } retryCount:5 retryInterval:2.0 progressive:false fatalStatusCodes:@[@401, @403]];
```
### Log 
- Enable to see what is happening by setting the `AFHTTPSessionManager`’s `retryPolicyLogMessagesEnabled` property to `true`. *Disabled by default.*
